# PLS-900

#The data files for our final project in the repo are
 1) complete_tweets.rda <- the first round of twitter data we scraped. All Senators' main accounts, 1000 tweets each. 
                           The outcome of running the .rmd file 
 2) final_tweets.rda <- The final data used for the LDA. Heads of 10 most prominent Senate committees. 5,000 tweets each.
 
 3) topicdata.rda <- A dataset of the terms in each topic, identified by topic with a variable 1-10, one for each topic. 

 The code files for the final project in this repo are
 1) 'twitter data setup'.Rda <- code for pulling tweets from twitter and putting them into a workable form.
 2) 'LDA CODE FINISH'.Rda <- code for running the LDA for each Senator and storing the results
     as well as creating the wordcloud used in the poster


All .rmd files have detailed comments explaining each step and our justifications for them.
